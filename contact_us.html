        <h2><u>Sorry, We Can't Reply</u></h2>
KidsHealth can provide you with lots of general information to help you better understand health issues, but we regret that we can't send you a personal reply to any inquiry. Although we cannot reply personally, we do read all of our messages and take your input seriously.<br><br>
        
<h2><u>Why Not?</u></h2>
The best person to give you medical advice, diagnoses, and treatment is your doctor or other qualified medical professional. That's because getting good care means talking personally with your doctor, who can learn about you and ask you questions, carry out an exam, and — when necessary — order tests.
Your doctor also can help guide you to qualified psychologists and others expert in emotional and behavioral issues. The KidsHealth website is for educational purposes only.<br><br>
<h2><u>What if You Have a Question?</u></h2>
The first place to start is with your parent, who can either talk to you about your concern or help you find someone who can answer your question. Your doctor, school nurse or counselor, or another adult relative also can provide guidance on where to find the help you need.<br><br>
<h2><u>Is This an Emergency?</u></h2>
If this is an emergency, contact emergency services on homepage.<br><br>
